    <h1>Favorite Movies of My Life</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Soul</h2>
    <p>A stunning movie from Pixar. Beautiful songs, story telling and message</p>
    <h2>Your Name</h2>
    <p> It's the first anime movie I watched and omg it left an mark on me. Beautiful images, each frame are so beautiful and the storyline is great too. How they have inculcated the Theory of time travel alongside their Local Tradition is really a sight to watch</p>
    <h2>Up</h2>
    <P>I hope i can just forget it and rewatch it again. How an old man in order to flfill his wife's wish embark on a dangerous journey and in doing so meet his life ideal and uncovers his truth and also makes a good friend in the way.</P>
